<h1>Things I like</h1>
	<h2>Taxes</h2>

		<p>I like ta&#771;xes because sometimes people don't pay them, and when they don't pay them that gives me a chance to either take their stuff or make them pay me extra money</p>
	<h2>Paint</h2>

		<p>I like paint because it can make stuff look nice. Not just any paint though, this has to be super special paint that makes things sparkly and shine. Or just look like a rock, that works too.</p>
	<h2>Breaking Stuff</h2>
	<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PhEzGKy07qs/maxresdefault.jpg" style="width:150px;height:160px;">
		<p>I like breaking stuff because it is the best way to understand how something works, why it works, what it is actually supposed to do, and how to make it better</p>

<h1>Things I dont like</h1>
	<h2>Money</h2>
		<p>I dont like money because when I don't have money that means I can't spend it on things like Taxes, Paint, and Breaking Stuff. So really I like money, but I also don't like money.</p>
	<h2>Fixing Stuff</h2>
		<p>I don't like fixing stuff because it's the annoying part of breaking stuff. Anyone can break things, making it working again is the annoying hard part.</p>
